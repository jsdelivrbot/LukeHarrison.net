Great news! Mike Brewer Motors - a project I've been heavily involved in over the past few years - has won the 'Best Online Experience' at the Autotrader 2018 Retailer Awards.

My involvement with the Mike Brewer Motors website project ranged from being involved in early stakeholder meetings, where I helped to improve the user experience of the designs, to then developing all of its front-end codebase and Gulp-driven build system.

On a web project, any kind of customer feedback is always appreciated, however this is certainly something else!
