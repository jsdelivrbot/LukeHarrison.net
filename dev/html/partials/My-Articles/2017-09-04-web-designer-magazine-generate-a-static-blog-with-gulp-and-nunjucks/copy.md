I'm back in the latest edition of [Web Designer Magazine](https://www.myfavouritemagazines.co.uk/web-designer-print-back-issues/web-designer-issue-265/) with another tutorial titled "Generate a static blog with Gulp and Nunjucks", which went on sale 17th August.

In this tutorial, I explore how to generate a simple static blog from a JSON data file using the task runner Gulp and Mozilla‚Äôs templating engine Nunjucks. It involves writing JavaScript to organise and inject data into templates to generate static HTML for blog entries and listing pages. It's certainly a fun exercise for developers wanting to do something a little different with Gulp, and also happens to be the approach which this very website uses to generate its blog pages. 

As usual, if you have any follow-up questions about the tutorial, or just want to clarify any of the steps? Feel free to post in the comments below or shoot me over an [email](http://www.lukeharrison.net/contact).
